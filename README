 DESCRIPTION
 -----------
    AstroCTC (Astronomy CCD in Telescope Capture) is an application designed for 
    video and image capture of the Planets and the Moon. A suitable astronomy or
    modified webcam will give the best results, however it will work with most webcams.
    The camera driver must be V4L2 compliant.

    Numerous video and image formats are available, however FITS image support is
    mostly basic and should only be used by those familiar with it.

    AstroCTC is intended for use with Linux only.

    While AstroCTC is primarily designed for use in astronomy, it can also serve as a general
    webcam program.

 INSTALL
 -------
    There are several ways to install AstroCTC outlined below.

 1. DISTRIBUTION PACKAGE
 -----------------------
    This is the preferred method for installation.

    Download the latest distribution archive from here: 
    	https://github.com/mr-headwind/AstroCTC/tree/master/DIST_PACKAGES 
    to your download directory (eg. $HOME/Downloads).

    Start a terminal or xterm session
    cd $HOME/Downloads (or your download directory)
    tar xvzf astroctc-x.xx.tar.gz (where x.xx is the version number)
    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make
    sudo make install

    There are a number of package dependencies (see below) that will be highlighted
    during the configure process. These must be installed.

 2. DEB PACKAGE
 --------------
    A binary deb package file is available on SourceForge at:-

	https://sourceforge.net/projects/astroctc/?source=directory

    or go to the SourceForge home page and search for astroctc.

    It has been a little difficult to test this package properly so it is provided
    as is only. If you experience any problem with it, please let me know (see BUGS ... below).

 3. BUILD FROM SOURCE
 --------------------
    If you wish to build and/or work on AstroCTC separately, the git repository is located at:

    	https://github.com/mr-headwind/AstroCTC

    Either clone the repository or download the repository package to a suitable development 
    directory (eg. $HOME/Development/AstroCTC). You may also download individual files and there 
    is a RELEASES directory with various stable snapshot archives.
    If you elect to grab individual files be warned that these may be in a work-in-progress
    state and be unstable.
    	
    The icon image file 'astroctc.png' will need to be located appropriately:
    	cd $HOME
    	mkdir -P .local/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps
    	mkdir -P .local/share/pixmaps/astroctc
    	cd AstroCTC (or whatever directory was chosen for download)
    	ln -s astroctc.png .local/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/astroctc.png
    	ln -s astroctc.png .local/share/pixmaps/astroctc/astroctc.png

    If you wish to make your own distribution package the 'setup_AutoTools.sh' shell script 
    in the AutoTools directory will set up a release structure, but may need to be altered 
    if your directory structure is different.

 DEPENDENCIES
 ------------
    The GTK+ 3.0 and Gstreamer 1.0 libraries need to be installed and, for the most part,
    will likely already be present. However, if there is a problem, try:
    	sudo apt-get install libv4l-dev 
    	sudo apt-get build-dep libgtk-3-dev 
    	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gstreamer-developers/ppa
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0*
	sudo apt-get install gstreamer-tools
	sudo apt-get install libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev
    
    Additionally the following packages may be required (Note: this is how for Ubuntu):
    	sudo apt-get install libv4l-dev
    	sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev
    	sudo apt-get install libpng-dev
    	See below for FITS details

    Depending the graphics on your computer, you may also encounter errors pointing vaguely to
    some kind of 'va' or 'vaapi' problem. The following fixed this on my computer:-
    	sudo apt-get install vdpauinfo
    	sudo apt-get install vainfo
    	sudo apt-get install mesa-vdpau-drivers
    	export LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=vdpau
    	export VDPAU_DRIVER=r600

 FITS - BUILD FROM SOURCE OR INSTALL PACKAGE
 -------------------------------------------
    I find it easier to build the FITS library separately rather than install from the 
    package archive. The source and instructions are located at:

    	http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio

    You can also easily get the latest archive as follows:
    	
    	cd $HOME/Downloads
    	wget heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/software/fitsio/c/cfitsio_latest.tar.gz

    Briefly, download the code package and do the following:
    	cd /usr/local/src
	mv ~/Downloads/cfitsio????.tar.gz .		(where ???? is the version, eg. 3390)
	   OR 
	mv ~/Downloads/cfitsio_latest.tar.gz .
	tar zxvf cfitsio????.tar.gz 	(or cfitsio_latest.tar.gz)
	./configure --prefix=/usr
	make
	make install

    However, if installing from the package archive is preferred, you will need at least:
    	sudo apt-get install libcfitsio-bin 	(this should also install 'libcfitsio2',
    					         mandatory for 'deb' installation)
    	sudo apt-get install libcfitsio-dev	(not required for 'deb' installation)

 THINGS TO BE DONE
 -----------------
    Web page - possible Launch Pad or add add own ? (or leave it at the SourceForge one)
    Build a .deb package for apt-get install astroctc ?

 THINGS TO BE CHECKED OR REVIEWED
 --------------------------------

 KNOWN ISSUES / BUGS
 -------------------
    . On some computers and some cameras (and sometimes), changing the resolution of the video area will
      work the first time, but subsequent changes will be unpredictabe. The work-around is to
      select 'Camera' -> 'Restart Video' on the menu.
    . On some computers (probably where VAAPI is used) using 'autovideosink' will cause a core dump when
      the pipeline is closed and restarted. 'xvimagesink' and / or 'ximagesink' are used instead.
      A bug and test case have been submitted for this.
    . There is a problem using 'xvimagesink' and setting the Reticule on. The problem appears to be 
      after a 'return GST_PAD_PROBE_REMOVE;' probe command and will manifest with the message: 
      'libv4l2: error turning on stream: Invalid argument' (sometimes) and the video will freeze. 
      The work-around is to use 'ximagesink'. A bug and test case have been submitted for this.
    . There is a bug in Preferences window trying to select the capture directory. Cannot select 
      directory immediately. Need to shift selection a few times before 'Apply' is enabled.
    . There is a bug editing encoder property values as follows:-
      	 select cell, change value and click Save - value is lost unless cell selection is moved or user 
      	 hits enter first (Investigate using GtkEntry signal "preedit-changed" and  GtkEntryBuffer 
      	 signal "inserted-text").
    . There is an occasional error when AstroCTC is run for the first time in a session where the program 
      aborts with a core dump. This appears to be a problem with the driver and the camera not being ready.
      Running again usually works, but the transient nature makes this difficult to narrow down.
    . There is an issue using YUY2 in the video settings in combination with certain video capture
      formats (eg. YUY2/YUY2, YUY2/Ogg). This has only occurred with an ASUS built-in laptop camera,
      but there could possibly be others.
    . There is a problem with some resolution showing on the main window and taking snapshots where there
      is a delay. Some resolutions greater than 800 x 600 will show an image with lines. This seems to relate
      to the size of the drawing area.

 THE TECHNICAL STUFF
 -------------------
    AstroCTC has been developed in c and uses GTK+ 3.0 for user interfaces, GStreamer 1.0 for video
    handling functions and video4linux2 (v4l2) for snapshots and camera details. There are also a
    number of additional libraries required: cairo, png12, cfitsio, jpeg, pthread.

 BUGS & SUGGESTIONS
 ------------------
    Email any bugs, requests or suggestions to tony.buckley000@gmail.com

 ITEMS FOR IMPROVEMENT
 ---------------------
    . Stepwise operations for cameras that can handle them are not supported. (low prioity)
    . Sound is only an option if the camera (and driver) supports it. Could use sound card. (low priority)
    . Add facility to note/record telescope, conditions and location to any (optional) meta file
    . FITS support is very basic. Add ascii / binary tables with camera and other settings info. eg Title
    . Possibly change status information text at the bottom of the main window into a 
      GtkStatusBar. (low priority)
    . Only enable the Save button for presets (profiles) when the preset changes instead of 
      always enabled. This can be done but its quite messy (hint: pass the main ui pointer (m_ui)). 
      (low prioity)
    . For Night View, add a slider widget to allow the user to choose the degree of shading.
    . Add a facility to review recent snapshots as thumbnails and full view on selection. 
      On mouseover also show the 'meta' data (above). (low priority)
    . Investigate and include 'long exposure' options for cameras that support it.
    . Add a function on the Codec Properties window eg. an info. button or right button mouse click 
      to view a description of a particular property. Also the list a properties presented is not 
      exhaustive.
